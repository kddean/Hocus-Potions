intro=Greetings, miss. I represent an entity that has been keeping an eye on the use of magic in this world.
*It has come to my employer's attention that you have been dabbling in alchemical potions. I'm not here to sold you, far from it.
*Magic can be a tricky beast. I'd like to offer you some guidance! For a price of course...:

intro=So you're the misguided witch that has been plaguing the townspeople with unnatural concoctions. It's an honor to meet you!*I find that chaos is the lifeblood of the world. I work for an organization that one might say ensures the thriving of entropy. I could teach you our ways if you are interested.:
request_cat=As an initiation, we ask that you turn someone into a cat. Do this and I will gift unto you the rank of Sapling and with it the sworn allegiance of things that crawl, grow, and blossom.:
yes=Welcome to the ranks of the Nocturnal Administration of Talented Utilitarian Robed Entropics!:
wait=You have 1 day to decide.:
no=You deny Chaos? You must be an agent of that tentacled order-monger Notcthulhu!!! We will meet again, fiend.;
request_cat=cat potion;
