intro,"Greetings, my dear little witch. I serve as the patron of the humble nearby town. The health and wellbeing of the local townsfolk is of the utmost importance to me.*I pray that your intentions are the same.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_bad,"My dear young witch, I pray the day has come that you use your skills for good. I would like you to share your intentions with me. *Will you bring me a potion that best displays what you have to offer the humble people of this town?*I hope, for their sake, it is a kind one.",,,,,,,
request_assess_neutral,"My dear young witch, as the patron deity of this small town, it is my duty to regularly assess the skills of its more... eccentric residents.*Will you bring me a potion that best displays what you have to offer the humble people of this town?",,,,,,,
request_assess_good,"My dear, I am here to assess your skills.* You are already such a kind and benevolent witch, I eagerly await to see what you have to offer.*Will you bring me a potion that best displays what you have to offer the humble people of this town?",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_poison_bad,"I don't know what I expected.*You, my dear, you have much to learn about the world.","I don't know why you don't want to help people, my dear.*Your Aunt asked me to guide you, my dear, before...*...well, before she left this plane.","I can't believe this, young lady...*Although, at this point, I suppose I shouldn't expect more from you.*Your Aunt would be so disappointed in you.",,,,,
request_assess_poison_neutral,Ack! That didn't taste very nice.,Ack! This is horrible!*What did you just give to me?,"I don't think this is what I asked for...* Ahh, I'm not feeling very well.",,,,,
request_assess_poison_good,"Ack! Did you make a mistake, my dear?*This is definitely not what I asked for.","-choke- Was this some sort of prank, my dear?*Please do not do that again.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_healing_bad,"You must forgive me if I am skeptical*-sniff- -sniff-*...*Alright, that's a healing potion alright. Thank you, my dear.","Oh, thank goodness it wasn't something horrible again.*Not that I can die, really, though.",,,,,,
request_assess_healing_neutral,"Excellent color! Lovely consistency. You have great skill, my dear.","Mmm, yes! A few drops of this in the well should take care of the village's little...*...problem.",,,,,,
request_assess_healing_good,"Simply wonderful! You've outdone yourself again, my dear.*Thank you, it's always a pleasure to come visit your little cottage.*I do miss visiting your Aunt here, though.","Are you using your Aunt's old recipe for these?*They're simply wonderful, I daresay more potent and healthful than hers, even!*Don't tell her I said that though, not that you could, my dear!*Forgive me, I forget your kind is still mortal.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_invisibility_bad,"Hmm, a delicate flavor, balanced aftertaste...*Ah! Where did my hand go?*I can't believe you've done this again.",,,,,,,
request_assess_invisibility_neutral,"Um, did something happen?*Oh heavens, I can't see my hands!*I can't see my feet!*I'm leaving before you can do anything worse to me!","Oh dear, what just happened?*Ah! I'm gone! I hope this isn't going to last very long.",Heavens!*Did you really just turn me invisible?,,,,,
request_assess_invisibility_good,"Hmm, I can't say that this potion wor...*...ked... My dear! You've turned me invisible!*Was this supposed to be some prank? I can't say I find it very funny.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_mana_bad,"Are you sure this is okay?*-sniff-*Ah, you actually gave me a real potion this time. Thanks, I suppose.",,,,,,,
request_assess_mana_neutral,"Ah, what a lovely mana potion my dear.*I can feel the magic running wild through my veins.",Simply wonderful!*I feel so energetic. I'm ready to seize the day!,"I do love the color of a good mana potion, my dear. It's just like the sky on a bright sunny day.*Thank you, my dear.",,,,,
request_assess_mana_good,"Ahh, Wonderful. Simply wonderful.*Have I ever told you why I love mana potions so much, my dear, despite being what I am?*They're nostalgic. When I drink one, I feel like I did when I performed magic before I even became me.*Back then, it was so rare to feel such power flow through my body.","Mmmm, so much power in such a small bottle, my dear.*Your potions are potent, your Aunt would be proud.*Have I ever told you about the special potions she would make for me? They were quite similar to this.*I wonder if she still has her old recipe around somewhere. I would love to have it again, my dear.:",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_null_bad,"Oh well, at least it wasn't something horrible this time.*I guess you are slowly changing your ways, miss.","Did you mess up when trying to poison me again, miss?","This isn't even a real potion, miss, what is this even supposed to do?",,,,,
request_assess_null_neutral,"My dear, I know you're still learning, but I don't think this potion turned out quite right.*Is it supposed to be a sleeping potion? If so, you should add some Catnip or Lavender next time.","Um, what is this supposed to be, my dear?*If you were trying to make a healing potion, try adding some Lavender or Lambsgrass.","My dear, this potion isn't much of anything.*Are you having trouble making something work? It's alright, we all start somewhere.*You must always ensure that your ingredients have something in common if you want them to mix into something useful.",,,,,
request_assess_null_good,"That potion didn't feel very powerful, my dear. Please allow me to share some of my knowledge with you.*Mana potions can be very helpful, even for non-mages. Thistle and mugwort are both plants potent with arcane energies.*However, you must be careful with the mugwort. Too much in a potion and you'll make your customers sick!","My dear, I think this one didn't turn out quite right. Are you having trouble?*Nightshade is a powerful herb for its healing properties, but too much and it can become very toxic.*If you're trying to make a healing potion, be sure to add some Lavender or Lambsgrass too.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_sleep_bad,"If I were mortal, would this kill me in my sleep?*Do I even want to know, or would I just be further disappointed in you my dear?","This is certainly a sleeping potion, my dear. A powerful one, too.*Given your record, I wouldn't be surprised if this sleeping potion was a little too powerful for its own good.",,,,,,
request_assess_sleep_neutral,"-Yawn- I'm already feeling calm and relaxed.*This is even better than the herbal tea I usually use to settle down. Thank you, my dear.","-Yawn- You know, this is even stronger than the sleeping potions your Aunt used...*...used to*...make.",,,,,,
request_assess_sleep_good,"Ahh, Thank you, dear. -yawn-*Do you know how hard it is to quiet your mind when you're a being like me?*Maybe someday you'll find out like, well...*like someone else did.*Who?*I'm tired, can we discuss this another time?","Mmm, A find potion, my dear. -yawn-*Another wonderful, fine potion.",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_speed_bad,"My dear, an actual potion!*-sip-*ahh, it's not even poison at all!","Wonderful, my dear, a speed potion!*Now I can leave this cursed place even faster, before you trick me again.",,,,,,
request_assess_speed_neutral,Wow! Such energy in such a small bottle.*Do you ever put this in your tea in the morning? It would really get you going.,"Quite excellent. A few drops of this in the well should have the town's toadball team working wonders, don't you agree?*Does that count as cheating? What they don't know won't hurt!","My dear, you've learned so quickly!*Your Aunt would be so proud.",,,,,
request_assess_speed_good,"Another perfect potion, my dear!*Speed potions are helpful for many things, you know. You can give them to your local toadball team if you want your town to win the championship,*or you can give them to people who want to play tag!*There are so many happy things you can do with potions, my dear.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_assess_transformation_bad,"Stop it, my dear! You know you can't see me like this.",Miss! Please! Do not transform me again!*I implore you!,,,,,,
request_assess_transformation_neutral,Ahh! You can't see me like this! You won't understand!,"Ack! My Dear, You've transformed me!*Please, you can't see me like this!","Quick my dear, close your eyes while I leave!",,,,,
request_assess_transformation_good,"My dear, I know you want to understand what, no, who I am.*But please, it is not the right time. Please be patient.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
request_turnips_bad,"My dear young witch, it recently came to my attention that the town's beloved shopkeeper, Dante, has ordered too many turnips for his shop to sell!*He's unlikely to come to you in this time of strife, and I know you are typically unwilling to extend kindness to the residents of this town,*But perhaps, this once, you could make an exception and concoct a spell to make these tubers more useful to our town?*I will be sampling the brew first, of course, I wish not to endanger the townsfolk.*Please bring me a potion that will make these excessive turnips more useful!",,,,,,,

request_turnips_invisibility_neutral,"Invisible turnips? Well, I guess we can all just pretend Dante didn't order too many...*This doesn't really fix the problem of how much money he spent on those darn things though.*Thanks for trying at least, though, my dear.",,,,,,,
request_turnips_invisibility_good,My dear! In what way will turning the darn things invisible help? *I guess we can just pretend he didn't order too many if we can't see them.*I hope his shop isn't hurt too much by these horrid vegetables.,,,,,,,
